Prototype firmware for delta printers on an STM32F4xxx

Heavily influenced by, and based on Smoothieware. Shares a great deal of code from that project.
https://github.com/Smoothieware/Smoothieware


Plans are to handle Inverse kinematics per step for a delta printer, with
improved Motion Control from SmoothieWare created by Arthur Wolf.

Will use the STM32F4xxx HAL by STM, there are no plans to make it portable to other architectures.

Initial prototype will be on a STM32F4-discovery board.
