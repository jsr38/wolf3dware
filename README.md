# wolf3dware
Prototype firmware for delta printers on an STM32F4xxx

Heavily influenced by, and based on Smoothieware. Shares a great deal of code from that project.

Plans are to handle Inverse kinematics per step for a delta printer, with
improved Motion Control from SmoothieWare created by Arthur Wolf.
